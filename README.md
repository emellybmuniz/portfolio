This portfolio was built from scratch to serve as a central hub for my professional identity as a Frontend Developer.

- **📱 Fully Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures a seamless experience on any device, from smartphones to desktops.
- **🚀 Dynamic Project Showcase:** Projects are displayed in a clean grid, with a "Show More" button to progressively load additional work.
- **✨ Interactive UI:** Engaging user experience with a typing effect on the hero section and a certificate carousel.
- **✅ Functional Contact Form:** Integrated with [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) for easy and direct communication.
